# CAO-Semester-Project
A repository for my ESP-32 based project, in which I keep record of my code.
The project is a basic IoT system, which takes the input of the moisture level in the soil of plants.
From the web application, the user can choose the type of plant that they are dealing with. Sometimes, plants growing in indoor enviornments
are extremely sensitive to the amount of water they are recieveing. For example, succulents tend to die if one waters them more than once a week. Similarly, cathadelias prefers moist soil and more humid enviornments. So based on the type of plant, the user gets the output on whether the plant needs water, and aproximately how much time it will take to dry out.
